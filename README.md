# Utilizing SHAP to Measure Motif Feature Importance
This notebook contains the code needed to generate the feature importance of motifs from select proteins. We wish to measure the correlation between the Mean RNA Bind Protein (MeanRBP) value of a motif and its effect on expression rate (ER). We hypothesize that motifs with high *MeanRBP* will also have high *feature importance*, thus having a motif with a high MeanRPB will have a higher effect on the ER. To do this, we train an XGBoost Regressor on protein degredation data and use SHAP values to extract the feature importance of each motif. We then plot this against MeanRBP and measure their Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
